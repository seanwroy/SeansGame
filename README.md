# Seansgame

I'm new to Java and programming in general and this was my first real crack at coding. I decided to make a game
as I have a bit of (dated) experience modding and there are a few great tutorials available. I used CodeNMore's video tutorial
and added my own code on top of it. 

Feel free to take this code as well as the included assets and do what you wish with them.

### Installing

an executable when it's finished.
